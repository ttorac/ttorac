### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thiago, I am software Developer. In the last 6 years I took a 2-yr Electronics Engineering course, however, I still love working with software development and I am currently working my way back into the IT industry.

The gross of my experience comes from coding Java though I feel quite comfortable working with databases or coding front-end interfaces.
At the moment, I'm investing in catching up with latest technologies, especially the ones that are trending and fun to code.

Here are a few thing that I'm really passionate about:
-CTF challenges
-Game development
-Playing the guitar (maybe piano eventually)
-Electronics and circuits

<br />

Language and tools I've worked with:
-HTML
-CSS
-JS
-Java
-React
-Git
-Linux
-Databases (Oracle, MySQL, PosgreSQL)
-Visual Code Studio

If you wish to connect with me:

Live projects
-Sokoban demo
-Hatchways
